This repository contains a notebook that is testing out finding the MinHash (approximate) jaccard index between samples by treating sketches as an inverted index. I tested a few cases to see if the runtime of using an inveted index would be faster.

However, after referring back to the Mash paper (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x) I realize this idea won't work. This is because it's more complicated to find the approximate union of the genomes than just taking the union of the sketches (you must merge the hashes from both sketches and subset to the first 1000 or num hashes number of elements). This messes up with my original idea/implementation. In theory the inverted index approach could maybe give an upper bound on the Jaccard index between genomes though, which might be useful.
